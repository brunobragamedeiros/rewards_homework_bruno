# Manual Overview

Hey! Here are the bugs found while manually testing the system.

Severity ranges from S1 (critical) to S5 (cosmetic).


| Title | What is happening? | Steps | Severity (S1-S5)| Screenshot or video | 
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Bonus page returns 404 | For authenticated and not authenticated users the /about page returns 404. It looks like URL contains an extra path `/test` after about (`/about//test`), resulting in a malformed URL | 1. Access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) <br>2. In the navigation menu, click on About <br> 3. Page does not load successfully | S3 <br><br> Why: I'd add this bug as moderate severity because having pages return 404 affects the user experience negatively. Even though the /about page does not block core functionality, it weakens user trust. | <img width="1406" height="678" alt="bonus_page_returns_404" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac979da8-9f73-46bc-9b0a-8caadaf90b12" /> | 
| Cards title are missing an i (Ponts) | There are two cards displayed Ponts Redeemed and Ponts Remanining both are missing the letter i, it should be Points Redeemed and Points Remanining | 1. Access http://localhost:3000/ <br> 2. Check out the cards titles <br> Word Point is missing the i letter| S4 <br> <br> Why: It is a minor visual issue but as the problem is in the core workflow I added as S4 instead of S5. | <img width="1167" height="143" alt="card_titles_missing_i_letter" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f765481-727e-4707-9e67-31cef456210d" /> |
| Redeemed points always show +2 regardless of actual value | For any redeemed reward, the final redeemed points are cost of the reward + 2 points | 1. Access http://localhost:3000/ <br> 2. Choose a reward to be redemeed <br> 3. Click on Redeem this Reward <br> 4. Check the Ponts Redeemed card <br> 5. The points count displayed are the cost of the reward + 2 points | S2 <br><br> Why: Redeeming rewards is a core functionality of the reward systems and this bug impacts the workflow significantly as the points redeemed count is incorrect | <img width="1397" height="689" alt="redeemed_points_plus_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c08547-5d6e-415a-9b77-da4b6edbb790" /> |
|Points remaining after claiming reward always show +2 | When user claims a reward the total of points remaining have a fixed +2 value | Pre-requirements: make sure to have enough points remaining to claim the reward <br> <br> 1. Access http://localhost:3000/ <br> 2. Chose a reward to redeem <br> 3. Redeem the chosen reward <br> 4. Check the Points remaining value <br> 4. Click on Claim my rewards <br> 5. The total points remaining have changed, it shows the previous amount + 2 points | S2 <br><br> Why: Claiming rewards is a core functionality of the reward systems and this bug impacts the workflow significantly as the points remaining count is incorrect | [loom](https://www.loom.com/share/f4bd330c0eeb4efbaafd378958df288c)|
| After forfeiting points user sees negative values | This only happens in non authenticated users, issue is seen when forfeiting points and refreshing the page, instead of getting 0 remaining points, use gets -10 points | Pre-requirements: make sure you are not authenticated <br> <br> 1. Access http://localhost:3000/ <br> 2. Click on forfeit all points  <br> 3. Check points remaining value <br> 4. Refreshes the page <br> Remaining points are now -10 | S3 <br><br> Why: forfeiting rewards is an important feature in the system but as this bug was only seen in non authenticated users, therefore the impacted group is smaller, and it does not block main workflow as there are workarounds (add more bonus), S3 is a good fit. | [loom](https://www.loom.com/share/d65e5eccccd548d994fcd1d0010d9841) |
